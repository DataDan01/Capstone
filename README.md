# Capstone
This is my Capstone Project for the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. 

File descriptions:

Loading_and_Processing_Final.R --> Deals with loading and processing the raw data. This basically converts the unstructured text into usable tables for the prediction model.

Prediction_Model_Final.R --> Processes data a bit more to reflect novelty counts. Algorithm and supporting functions are here.

New_Pred.R --> Experimenting with new ideas.

Testing.R --> Tuning the novelty function to maximize accuracy. Function needs more work.

App --> Folder contains all the files for the Shiny app.
